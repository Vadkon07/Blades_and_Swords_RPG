## Development Status
This game is currently in an early stage of development and was created just for fun, but for now we noticed that this game can be turned into something bigger pretty easy. Our main idea - full RPG video game, but only in terminal.

For now we are looking for more developers which are ready to help us with development. With a big community we can easily build the biggest terminal-based video game in the world. Just imagine: 100 people develope video game together every day, what this video game will looks like even just one month later?

## To-Do List
Here are some future enhancements and features that could be added to the game:

- [ ] **Expand Quests:** Introduce more complex quests with branching storylines and choices that affect outcomes.
- [ ] **Improve Combat System:** Add more combat mechanics, such as special abilities and different types of attacks.
- [ ] **Add More Locations:** Develop additional locations with unique events, enemies, and rewards.
- [ ] **Enhance Inventory Management:** Allow players to upgrade weapons, craft items, and manage equipment slots.

- [ ] **Enhance Graphics and UI:** Upgrade the game’s visual presentation and user interface for a better experience.
- [ ] **Optimize Code:** Refactor and optimize the existing codebase for better performance and maintainability.
- [ ] **Bigger Team:** For this project we have only 2 developers, and it will be nice if we will find more people for our team. With 3-4 people in team we can significantly boost our process of development.
- [ ] **Optimise Quests:** Quests are for a little empty for now, we have to add them more.
- [X] **Solve Sleep In Village House:** He doesn't print "Zzz...". 
- [ ] **ASCII arts:** We can add 2D or 3D ASCII arts for locations and maybe something else.
- [ ] **Clean:** In code we have 'manage relationships' and 'character relationships', and at all that's fully the same things which only use space in our code.
1. Delete point number 5 from menu.
2. Combine points number 5 and 6 only in point number 5.
- [x] **Bug Fixes and Stability Improvements:** Regularly test and fix bugs to ensure smooth gameplay.
